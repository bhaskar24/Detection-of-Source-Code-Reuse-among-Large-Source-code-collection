# Detection of Source Code Reuse among Large Source code Collection 2015

## Abstract
Existing plagiarism detection techniques are based on determining the syntactic difference between two source codes or comparing the syntax tree. All these techniques lack optimization of source code. Optimization can be achieved by loop unrolling, code hoisting, moving computation to some variable, macro function and strength reduction. Our proposed algorithm is based on establishing optimization equivalent based on the static scoping and finally make comparison on resultant syntax tree. Another important contribution of this paper lies in detection of plagiarism amongst two or more students in a large group of classes. Previous work focus on comparison of one code with other for detection of plagiarism and are computational very expensive in case of detecting groups of student involved and his personal opinion in a large class. The results are shown in the form of matrix representation between the exact code and the copied code. Precision of our algorithm is determined by first perform training on large data set of 600c source code (available in TREC)
